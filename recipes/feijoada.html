<h2>Feijoada, typical dish from Brazil</h2>
<p>Many of the countries represented in this year's World Cup have a national dish that they consider their own; Yorkshire pudding in the U.K., kimchi in South Korea, wienerschintzel in Austria, Tom Yum (one of the few) in Thailand and many more.</p>
<p>In Brazil, the dish to have is feijoada (fey-jwah-duh). Feijoada wonâ€™t be found in the U.S. on the menus of Fogo de Chao or other churrascarias, but the flavors found in a bowl of feijoada is enough to battle any night out with wandering spits of barbecued meats.</p>
